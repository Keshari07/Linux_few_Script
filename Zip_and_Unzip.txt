In Ubuntu 22.04, you can use the zip and unzip commands to compress and decompress files and directories, respectively. Here are some examples:

Zip (compress) a file or directory:
To compress a single file:

bash
Copy code
zip compressed_file.zip file.txt
To compress multiple files:

bash
Copy code
zip compressed_files.zip file1.txt file2.txt file3.txt
To compress an entire directory and its contents:

bash
Copy code
zip -r compressed_directory.zip directory_name
Unzip (decompress) a file:
To unzip a file:

bash
Copy code
unzip compressed_file.zip
To unzip to a specific directory:

bash
Copy code
unzip compressed_file.zip -d destination_directory
Example: Compressing and Decompressing
Let's create a sample scenario with a file and a directory:

bash
Copy code
# Create a directory with some files
mkdir my_directory
echo "Hello World!" > my_directory/file1.txt
echo "This is a test." > my_directory/file2.txt

# Zip the directory
zip -r my_directory.zip my_directory

# Unzip the file to a new directory
mkdir extracted_directory
unzip my_directory.zip -d extracted_directory
Now, you'll have a compressed file (my_directory.zip) and an extracted directory (extracted_directory) with the contents of the original directory.

Adjust the file and directory names accordingly based on your actual use case. The -r option in the zip command is used for recursively including the contents of directories.
